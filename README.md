# AdventureWorksCycles-Project
Final Project for the Microsoft Professional Program on Data Science

The purpose of the final project is to apply what you have learned about the data to building, testing, and optimizing predictive machine learning models. Specifically, you must use your tool of preference to create:

1) A classification model that predicts whether or not a new customer will buy a bike.
2) A regression model that predicts the average monthly spend of a new customers.

To complete this challenge:

1) Use the Adventure Works Cycles customer data (AWCustomers.CVS and AWSales.CVS) to create a classification model that predicts whether or not a customer will purchase a bike. The model should predict bike purchasing for new customers for whom no information about average monthly spend or previous bike purchases is available. Refine your model to optimize its accuracy.

2) Next, create a regression model that predicts a customer's average monthly spend. The model should predict average monthly spend for new customers for whom no information about average monthly spend or previous bike purchases is available. Refine your model to optimize its RMSE.

3) Download the test data (AWCTest-classification.CVS and AWCTest-regression.CVS). This data includes customer features but does not include bike purchasing or average monthly spend values.

4) Test your models using the corresponding test dataset, and enter your predictions. Note that you can a maximum of 10 times for each model.
